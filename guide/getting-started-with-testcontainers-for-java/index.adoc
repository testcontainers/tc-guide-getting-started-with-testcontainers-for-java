Testcontainers is a testing library that provides easy and lightweight APIs for bootstrapping integration tests with real services
wrapped in Docker containers. Using Testcontainers, you can write tests talking to the same type of services you use in production
without mocks or in-memory services.

[NOTE]
If you are new to Testcontainers then please
read https://testcontainers.com/guides/introducing-testcontainers[What is Testcontainers, and why should you use it?]
to learn more about Testcontainers.

Let us look at how we can use Testcontainers for testing a Java application using a Postgres database.

== Create a Java project with Maven

Create a Java project with Maven build tool support from your favorite IDE.
We are using Maven in this article, but you can use Gradle if you prefer.
Once the project is created, add the following dependencies to the *pom.xml*.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{codebase}/pom.xml[lines="18..34,41..49,82..83"]
----

We have added a Postgres JDBC driver for talking to the Postgres database, *logback-classic* for logging and *junit-jupiter* for testing with JUnit 5.
Also, we have used the latest version of *maven-surefire-plugin* to support JUnit 5 tests.

== Implement business logic

We are going to create *CustomerService* class to manage customer details.

First let us create a *Customer* class as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/Customer.java[]
----

Create *DBConnectionProvider.java* class to hold JDBC connection parameters and create a method to get database *Connection* as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/DBConnectionProvider.java[]
----

Create *CustomerService.java* class and add the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/CustomerService.java[]
----

Let us understand what is going on in CustomerService class.

* We are calling *connectionProvider.getConnection()* method to get a database Connection using JDBC API
* We have the *createCustomersTableIfNotExists()* method that creates the customers table if it does not already exist.
* We have *createCustomer()* method that inserts a new customer record into the database.
* We have the *getAllCustomers()* method that fetches all rows from *customers* table, populates data into *Customer* objects
  and returns a list of Customer objects.

Now let us see how we can test *CustomerService* logic using Testcontainers.

== Add Testcontainers dependencies
Before writing Testcontainers based tests let's add Testcontainers dependencies in *pom.xml* as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{codebase}/pom.xml[lines="35..40"]
----

As we are using a Postgres database for our application, we added the Testcontainers Postgres module as a test dependency.

== Write test using Testcontainers
Create *CustomerServiceTest.java* under *src/test/java* with the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/test/java/com/testcontainers/demo/CustomerServiceTest.java[]
----

Let us understand the code in our CustomerServiceTest.

* We declared *PostgreSQLContainer* by passing the Docker image name *postgres:16-alpine*.
* The Postgres container is started using JUnit 5 *@BeforeAll* callback, which gets executed before running any test methods.
* In *@BeforeEach* callback method, which gets executed before running every test method, we have created a *DBConnectionProvider* instance
  by passing the JDBC connection parameters obtained from the Postgres container and also created a *CustomerService* instance.
  In the *CustomerService* constructor, we are creating the customers table if it does not already exist.
* We have a *shouldGetCustomers()* test where we are inserting 2 customer records into the database, fetching all the existing customers
  and asserting the number of customers.
* Finally, we are stopping the postgres container in *@AfterAll* callback method, which gets executed after all the test methods
  in that class are executed.

If you run the *CustomerServiceTest* you can see in the logs that Testcontainers pulled the Postgres Docker image
from DockerHub if not already available locally, started the container and executed the test.

Voila!!! You have your first Testcontainers-based test running.

== Conclusion

We have explored how to use Testcontainers for Java library for testing a Java application using a Postgres database.

We have seen how writing an integration test using Testcontainers is very similar to writing a unit test which you can run from your IDE.
Also, any of your teammates can clone the project and run tests without installing Postgres on their computers.

In addition to Postgres, Testcontainers provides dedicated modules to many commonly used SQL databases, NoSQL databases, messaging queues, etc.
You can use Testcontainers to run any containerized dependency for your tests!
